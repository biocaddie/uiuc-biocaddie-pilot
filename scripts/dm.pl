# MODIFICATIONS
#  - Updated by Jamie Callan:  02/11/2015
#    Modified to support a less cryptic Indri-like query language.
#    #combine --> #and, #1 --> #near/1, #weight --> #wand, and #uw --> #window/
#
# NOTES
#
#    * this script assumes that the query string has already been parsed and that all characters
#      that are not compatible with Indri's query language have been removed.
#
#    * it is not advisable to do a 'full dependence' variant on long strings because of the exponential
#      number of terms that will result. it is suggested that the 'sequential dependence' variant be
#      used for long strings. either that, or split up long strings into smaller cohesive chunks and
#      apply the 'full dependence' variant to each of the chunks.
#
#    * the unordered features use a window size of 4 * number of terms within the phrase. this has been
#      found to work well across a wide range of collections and topics. however, this may need to be
#      modified on an individual basis.
